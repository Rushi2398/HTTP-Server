Hi, I’m Rushikesh, a backend-focused Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience building scalable, containerized microservices using Go, Node.js, Docker, and PostgreSQL. I’ve led multiple full-stack projects in the fintech and enterprise domains, delivering high-impact features like low-latency insurance APIs and real-time Excel data processing, which reduced dev and maintenance overhead by over 80%.
What sets me apart is that I don’t just write code - I solve business problems. From automating manual workflows that saved 70% operational effort, to designing resilient microservices and data pipelines, I focus on clean architecture, fast iteration, and measurable outcomes. I’m excited about Intuit because of its strong engineering culture and customer-first approach and I’m confident I can contribute as a reliable, product-aware SDE-II.
